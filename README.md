## üë®‚Äçüíª Projects

### Underwater Robotics Summer Camp - Deepblue Maker

**Hangzhou Dianzi University, China | July 2025 - August 2025**

Worked alongside a team of 6 students to design and build an underwater robot that can navigate through water and perform tasks such as mapping the environment and detecting sea life.

#### Key Components

- **Mechanical Design**: CAD design in Solidworks and 3D printing of parts. Physical testing for water sealing and buoyancy.
- **Electrical Systems**: STM32 microcontroller to control the robot's thrusters from a desktop computer.
- **Software Development**: Raspberry Pi 5 for live camera feed and display. Developed an object detection model using YOLO to detect sea life.
